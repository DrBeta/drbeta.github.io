Finally I abandoned Squarespace and created my own site! I was paying $16/month for that site I didn't really like.

I started making it a few days ago. I started making it just by hand without a static site generator because static site generators were kind of scary. But after I looked at Jekyll a bit, it was actually pretty easy! So that is how we are here. More posts coming soon.
