Articles like [these](https://hackernoon.com/why-learning-coding-is-important-for-kids-in-this-digital-age-7m7v31l4) give me the impression like we are supposed to force kids into coding. What most don't realize is that so many kids discover it on their own without a class but most of them publish stuff under a pseudonym because that is what they are comfortable with. Not everyone is meant to code. In fact, most of the people in the profession discovered it on thier own, a lot of times through silly things like making a geocities site or mods to games. Please don't shove this down our thoat.
